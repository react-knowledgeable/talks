# ⚛️ React Knowledgeable

React Knowledgeable, nicknamed `<RK />`, is a fair and friendly podium to share what we learn about React.

This repo is used to collect and organize talk proposals for our events.

You can find all our talk information and schedules in [our issues](https://github.com/Shopee/react-knowledgeable/issues).

## 📝 cool kids learn in public

The guiding principle of `<RK />` is to [#learnInPublic](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/9720bd4a30606ca3ffb8d407113c0fe5), _share knowledge and have fun_. Everyone is encouraged to keep giving talks about what you learned and found interesting.

## ⚡️ we will be doing lightning talks

So, cool kids. Lightning talks don't mean just short. Lightning talks are super cool and fun, and guess what, compact and fast-paced!

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRyk5ZVklFs) is one of the most amazing lightning talk we've seen. Andres Suarez had 270 seconds to introduce everyone to Flow with nuclide, he asks you to buckle up, and at 33 seconds he has his slide that says DEMO.

_Need ideas to talk?_

Think about this:

**What is an interesting problem that you encountered this week, and how you managed to solve it?**

Or, when you are running into trouble:

> 🤔 ... this is weird
> 🧐 ... this is strange
> 🙄 ... i'm so frustrated
> 🙊 ... doesn't work

Tweak your inner voice a little bit:

**😎 this is interesting**

Then tell us how it is interesting.

Maybe you are already flying around the world to give conference talks, consider doing a lightning version of your talk at <RK /> and test if your idea makes sense 🤗.
